## Installation

To get manyawk:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/b4b4r07/manyawk
```

Then you'll need to set the [AWKPATH](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/AWKPATH-Variable.html#AWKPATH-Variable) environment variable to this library directory root when using manyawk.

```console
$ export AWKPATH=/path/to/manyawk    # this library
```

## Usage

You must load modules from manyawk you want to use and add `@include "module/module.awk"` to your awk script.

```awk
#!/usr/bin/env gawk -f

@include "math/similarity.awk"

BEGIN {
    printf("%f%\n", similarity(ARGV[1], ARGV[2]))
}
```

To save the awk script above as `leven_dist.awk`, and to run:

```console
$ AWKPATH=. awk -f leven_dist.awk "awk is fun" "gawk is fun"
95.238095%
```
